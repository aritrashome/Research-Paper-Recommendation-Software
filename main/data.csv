In this paper, we study energy ef cient precoding for coordinated multi point  CoMP  transmission for HetNets. We formulate a problem that maximizes the energy ef ciency under the constraints of individual date rate requirement from each user, maximal transmit power of each base station  BS , and zero forcing  ZF  for a HetNet where the macro BS cooperates with multiple pico BSs. We then simplify the problem with the help of the practical topology of HetNets where the macro BS cooperates with each of the pico",2,35.933136746338455,687,59,2

Woodruff Jinous Kasravi David Comp  I n t r o d u c t i o n  The story of U.S. undergraduate student participation in education abroad  in the latter part of the 20th century centers on broadening access for students  who previously did not have or did not take advantage of opportunities for edu  cation abroad, or higher education itself. In this chapter we explore the diversi  fication of the profile of students participating in education abroad from 1960  to  2005.  Indeed,  diversification  is  equally  the   democratization  of  access   as  described in 1987 by Jack Egle, then President and Executive Director of the  Council on International Educational Exchange  Bowman, p. 5 . This democra  tization of education abroad is largely a result of eliminating barriers to access in  higher education, from the 1950s onward. Reducing the barriers to and encour  aging participation in education abroad has bee",0,6.03632384,21,61,1
